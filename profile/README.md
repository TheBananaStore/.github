# The Banana Team
<!--
**Most of the time, Linux isn't taken serious by app developers**. 
They don't think of it as a plaform their end users will be on, and provide no support for it, despite developing their software on Linux. 
Windows and Mac OS X are more targeted, because of the developers' hostility towards Linux, and some developers may have sponsors that do not want their software on Linux. 
This way, Linux becomes a very complicated enviroment for beginners who expect their favorite apps. 
They have to follow outdated tutorials, spend 5 hours on Google trying to find an answer, or completely brick their computer by mistyping a command.
Let me introduce you to **The Banana Store**:
The Banana Store is an app store for all Linux distributions, where you can install all of your favorite apps everywhere in one click.
You don't need to be an advanced Linux user to install an app anymore. All you need is the Banana Store. -->
